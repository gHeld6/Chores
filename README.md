# Chore Tracker
This program is used with the Raspberry Pi to display and track chores for 2 people. The project will have two main parts. One is a program to read the data from the file and display it on the lcd screen and deal with the hardware on the Raspberry Pi. The other will be a web application that can be accessed on a local network. This will be used to update the chore list.
